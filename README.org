#+TITLE: Shapeless Blog

The repo is in heavy development, and does not work at the moment.

Shapeless blog is a minimalistic blog server intended for my personal
use. It does only one thing, blogging in Emacs org mode.

* Basic requirement
- A web server for hosting your blog, e.g. a VPS server. Share host is
  not enough.
- Nginx for reverse proxy.
- Emacs.
